company will never use the image from docker hub directly
they get the image from docker hub and harden the image by security and tag it according to the company policies
For example in case of the company Devops easylearning
they will have insteadof :
FROM node 17
they will have:
FROM devopseasylearning2021/s3-mysql:001
LABEL "Company"= "Devops-easy-learning"
you cannot pull an image in dockerhub over 100 times in 6 hours
